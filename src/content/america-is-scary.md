America is undeniably frightening right now. Politically motivated violence seems to be on the rise. At a time when we desperately need responsible leadership to guide us away from hatred and violence, we find ourselves without it. Free speech faces genuine threats from government officials at the highest levels. All this unfolds against the backdrop of one of the most politically charged and socially divided periods in American history.

I was already anxious before Charlie Kirk's killing, but the weeks since have only intensified my sense of uncertainty. Like millions of Americans, I've been bombarded with news about this terrible act. Living through its aftermath has deepened my concerns about the future of our nation.

## Whatever Your Politics, Kirk's Murder Is Inexcusable

I'll be the first to admit that I found much of Charlie Kirk's rhetoric about minorities, women, and liberals to be dehumanizing, inappropriate, potentially dangerous, and morally misaligned with my own beliefs. However, I firmly believe he had every right to express his views and that others had every right to listen if they chose. I would never have attended Kirk's events, but I defend his right to speak just as I would defend my own. If [Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Party_of_America_v._Village_of_Skokie) could demonstrate in Skokie, then Kirk had the right to speak on campus.

The notion that one person could decide Kirk's right to free speech was nullified by his opinions is absurd. Murdering Kirk for his speech fundamentally undermines one of our essential liberties. Despite my profound disagreements with Kirk's views, I believe unequivocally that he should be alive today, able to exercise his free speech rights, with others free to listen if they wish. Anyone who thinks otherwise should reconsider their moral position. No one should celebrate this tragedy—if Kirk's exercise of free speech justified his death, then any of our speech could warrant the same fate.

## Who's In Charge Here?

Most people would agree that Kirk's murder was abhorrent. You'd also think most would find it dangerous and irresponsible to blame his death on an entire group of people who had nothing to do with it and who also condemn the act. Yet figures in the highest levels of government—including the White House and Congress—are doing exactly that. Some have blamed Kirk's murder on the ["radical left"](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-doubles-blaming-radical-left-after-vow-after/story?id=125509965) and promised to combat "organized political violence" from the left. Even at Kirk's [memorial](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5549407/charlie-kirk-memorial-republican-party-trump-revival-retribution), these officials continued pushing the narrative that Kirk was killed by a conspiracy of liberal Democrats determined to murder conservatives.

This rhetoric is irresponsible, divisive, and dangerous. Despite the obvious risks apparent to any observer, America's leadership seems incapable of offering anything better. Rather than defusing tensions or simply staying silent, they actively inflame the situation, using Kirk's murder as a [political weapon](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/21/trump-lionizes-charlie-kirk-warns-of-dangers-to-america-00574586?utm_) against Democrats. Consider how twisted this is—exploiting someone's murder for political gain. If it wasn't clear before, it is now: America lacks mature leadership. We're adrift without adults in the room.

## Trickle Down Hatred

While our leaders' behavior is troubling enough, what's more frightening is how these attitudes filter down to ordinary people. The New York Times podcast [_The Daily_](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5549407/charlie-kirk-memorial-republican-party-trump-revival-retribution) covered Kirk's memorial and interviewed attendees—regular people, some of whom traveled hundreds of miles to be there. What shocked me was their expressed desires. The "us versus them" mentality was unmistakable. One person stated, "I want to hear true leadership say that they will no longer tolerate this. Not with words, but with policies, with laws, no longer being tolerant to the left." This statement couldn't be clearer: tolerance is off the table. The fundamental idea that we can hold different beliefs while coexisting in this country is essential for civil society, yet a segment of the population has apparently abandoned this principle. The concern is obvious: how can we maintain a functioning society when we refuse to tolerate differences?

On a deeper level, when tolerance disappears, political violence becomes more conceivable. I don't expect an army of conservatives to suddenly attack Democrats in cities. However, I worry that those already prone to violence will find it easier to justify their actions. Another memorial attendee told _The Daily_, "It really feels like they killed one of ours." If you're already open to political violence and believe a collective "they" is targeting you, it becomes easier to contemplate retaliating by "killing one of theirs."

## Here's The Real Problem

To conclude, I have to emphasize that Charlie Kirk's murder was inexcusable, regardless of political beliefs. All violence, political or otherwise, is reprehensible. In America, we don't face an epidemic of organized political violence. Instead, we confront a leadership crisis where political intolerance is normalized through inflammatory rhetoric. People on the fringes who already consider violence a legitimate political tool will find it increasingly easier to silence, injure, and kill others. If we're not careful, this may become America's future—a prospect that should alarm everyone who values our nation's fundamental principles.
