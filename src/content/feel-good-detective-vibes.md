Thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing Group I received an eARC copy of *The World's Greatest Detective and Her Just Okay Assistant* by Liza Tully! Detective mysteries are not my normal reading territory but I found myself enjoying the adventure of the world's greatest detective Audrey Merritt and her just okay Gen Z assistant Olivia Blunt way more than I expected I would. The adventure of Blunt and Merritt will be available starting July 8, 2025.

> Tully delivers a feel-good detective mystery full of murder, intrigue, and logical deduction that kept me guessing whodunit until the very end. I strongly recommend that anyone who is a fan of detective mysteries or is looking for a feel-good story to lose themselves in pick up a copy from your local library or bookstore ASAP!

## A dream job with some rough edges

Olivia Blunt has spent weeks doing nothing but boring computer work when the chance to work with the famous detective Audrey Merritt comes her way. Blunt is thrilled to work with the brilliant detective but quickly learns that her new boss won't be as easy to get on with as she'd hoped. Merritt is cold, demanding, and not particularly impressed with her  previous Gen Z assistants. Blunt is determined to be the exception but this is easier said than done.  The opportunity to prove herself comes after Vermont socialite Victoria Summersworth is found dead in an apparent suicide that doesn't sit right with her daughter, Haley. Merritt is hired to find out what really happened to Victoria and Blunt is invited to tag along (and to chauffeur Merritt from NYC to Lake Champlain). From here the story begins down its winding investigatory path of clues, suspects, and revelations.

## A quirky dynamic and interesting character dynamic

One of my favorite things about Tully's novel is the fun and quirky dynamic between her main characters Olivia Blunt and Audrey Merritt. It was fun to see the mystery unfold and navigate the facts and clues of the case from the perspective of the assistant who is honestly just trying her best. I could relate to Olivia Blunt throughout the entire novel. Who hasn't tried to impress their boss at one point, made a few (or more than a few) mistakes, and ended up a little embarrassed from time to time. The dynamic between Blunt and Merritt also helps strengthen the mystery elements in the novel. We learn about the case and clues through the lens of the just okay assistant who has more questions and answers and is quick to believe the best in people.

## A standout cast of supporting characters

Blunt and Merritt aren't the only strong characters in Tully's novel. She also delivers a group of strong supporting characters who bring just as much to the story as the main duo. Each supporting character plays an important role in the case and comes with their own over-the-top and memorable personality. This group of characters help the novel feel dynamic and bring the reader right into case. At times I felt like I was in the room questioning the money loving boyfriend or the resentful step-children. I never felt like the story lacked interesting characters.
