While most of the country is bracing for a winter storm this weekend, brave Americans in Minneapolis are facing off against authoritarianism and tyranny in the streets. Unfortunately they are paying a steep price for their stand. Many have been brutalized, detained, arrested, and terrorized by the federal government. And, this weekend another American in Minneapolis was murdered by the governments out of control agents.

## Free Speech Isn't Free Anymore

Two Americans citizens and residents of Minneapolis have been killed by their own government for excising their constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech. Renee Good and Alex Pretti used their voice to express their dissatisfaction, anger, and frustration with the federal government and the tyranny being carried out in its name on the streets of their city. That same government wontedly executed these two Americans, spread lies about them, and slandered them as domestic terrorists. If is not clear already I'll state it simply. Free speech isn't free anymore in the version of America we live in now.

## They See Themselves Above The Law

ICE is acting like they exist above the law. Agents are violating our civil liberties, abusing and killing anyone they see as an obstacle, and obstructing actual law enforcement from investigating the government perpetrated abused they leave in their wake.

Worst of all, ICE will not stop until they've broken the spirit of every American who is disgusted by their tyranny and abuse. Don't be fooled the convenient excuse they put put. This is not about immigration anymore. The federal government is out to strip away the freedom of Americans who oppose its actions and who they deem as enemies. Its boots on the ground is ICE. The violence happening on the streets of Minneapolis and shared across the county on social media is designed to terrorize and silence us all.

## It's Time For Something To Change

Right now I feel horrified and sad about the state of the country and the way that the federal government is treating Americans. Every American should be disgusted by what is going in Minneapolis. The freedoms of everyday Americans are being violently stripped away. The very foundation of the country's ideals are being challenged. It is well beyond time for the lawless president and those he has empowered to be reined in, held to account for their abuses of power, and made to understand that Americans will not tolerate violence and tyranny. Everyone should contact each and every representative they have in Washington and demand they stand up to Trump and anyone else who supports him today and every day!
