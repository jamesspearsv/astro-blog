Recently I've been very troubled, concerned, and worried by ICE activities locally and nationally. Here in North Central West Virginia ICE has raided local restaurants and detained people while at their work, stranded students at school after their parents were detained, and placed more than a few local businesses at risk. All the while not making a single person in West Virginia safer and sowing confusion and chaos. This local news also comes amid national news of ICE endangering and killing Americans in Minnesota and other places across the country. These actions are deeply unpopular but ICE is propped up by a president and group of allies who have somehow convinced themselves that they're making the lives of average Americans better.

If it isn't clear already I think that the use of ICE to essentially harass, detain, and deport people in this way is wrong and unacceptable. It's true that many of the people detained are undocumented but otherwise have done nothing wrong and are in the country to improve their lives.

## The Land of Opportunity

I've always been taught that America the land of opportunity. Here it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. Anyone can make something for themselves if they work hard. This is an ideal of course but it still holds some weight in reality. If you work hard, if you contribute, if you save then you can scrape together a life for yourself here. Despite the numerous flaws and imperfections of America I think that is what makes the country great. It might not be easy but it is possible to put together a safe life here unlike it is in large parts of the world. But I don't understand why so many people are so set against others coming here and contributing to that ideal. If opportunity is what makes America a great country then I think that opportunity only exists when  we're all contributing to that ideal.

## A Rising Tide And Whatnot

A rising tide lifts all boats. Everyone should know what this means. When something we're all apart of gets better we all benefit. When I think of this my mind lands on this idea: we all need to eat, all want to go shopping, all need to run errands and chores. We need people to work those jobs to check us out at the grocery store, cook the food we order at our favorite restaurant, change the oil in our car at the mechanic. Those people need to eat too, want to go shopping too, need to run errands too. They'll visit businesses, spend money, generate more jobs, etc. It's a cycle and benefits from more people being in the cycle of spending. It seems clear to me that we would be at our best when we're open and welcoming. We should encourage new people to participate and contribute that the economy through work and consumption. But at this moment a huge contingent of Americans from the White House down are intent on draining millions of people and dollars out of the cycle. Maybe to put it in different terms, they're interested in pulling the tide away from the country's boat.
