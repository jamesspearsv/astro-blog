Earlier this month, my wife and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary by traveling to Jefferson County, West Virginia. Nearby, in Sharpsburg, Maryland, lies Antietam National Battlefield—a site I’ve wanted to visit since we moved to West Virginia five years ago. This trip was the perfect opportunity to finally experience a place of profound historical significance.

## Historical Background

The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, remains one of the most consequential battles of the American Civil War. It was the first major battle of the war fought on Union soil and marked a pivotal victory for the Union army after a series of summer defeats. This triumph gave President Abraham Lincoln the momentum to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, broadening the Union’s aims to include the end of slavery. Yet, the victory came at an unimaginable cost—nearly 23,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, or missing over just 12 hours of fighting. To this day, Antietam stands as the bloodiest single day in American history.

## Arrival and Orientation

Antietam National Battlefield is renowned as one of the most well-preserved and restored battlefields in the country. Established in the 1890s and managed by the U.S. War Department and later the National Park Service, the site has undergone meticulous restoration. Efforts by the National Park Service and the American Battlefield Trust have ensured that visitors can almost step back in time and experience the events of that fateful day.

We began our visit at the visitors center, the recommended starting point for anyone exploring the battlefield. Normally, the center is filled with engaging exhibits about the battle, although most were temporarily removed due to a water leak during our visit. However, the theater’s film provided an important primer for what we’d witness across the park. The visitors center sits atop a hill, offering nearly 360-degree views of the battlefield—an excellent orientation to the historic landmarks that shaped our day.

## Touring the Battlefield

We opted for the self-guided driving tour, which covers nearly 10 miles and includes 10 official stops representing key moments and sites from the battle (forgive us—it was August!). The journey begins at the Dunker Church, standing atop a hill along what was Hagerstown Pike in 1862. During the battle, this small white church was one of the few visible landmarks and the focal point of intense attacks and counterattacks. Starting here helped us visualize the terrain and grasp the magnitude of the events.

Next, we headed to the North Woods and Poffenberger Farm, where Union soldiers camped the night before the battle. Standing between these woods and the farm, anticipation hung heavy in the air—in 1862, men tried to steal moments of rest amid the distant echo of skirmishes, only to be jolted awake by artillery at dawn. Looking south, it was easy to imagine the anxiety faced by soldiers marching into mortal danger.

From there, the tour led us through the East Woods toward the Cornfield. The significance of these wooded areas became clear—men from both sides clashed in the East Woods even before dawn, and the earliest fighting of the day erupted here. At the edge of the Cornfield, just as it was in September 1862, tall stalks loomed above us. Here, those who survived the North Woods and the fighting in the East Woods emerged into a hail of rifle fire from Confederate lines. The Cornfield witnessed some of the battle’s most savage fighting; for nearly four hours, hundreds of men from both armies fell among the rows of corn. The park’s markers and outlines immerse visitors in the reality of 1862, forcing you to reflect on the individual experiences—fear, hope, determination—all felt both collectively and alone.

Continuing on, we approached the Mumma Farm down a lonely lane surrounded by farmland. This farm endured the only deliberate destruction of property during the battle, burned to the ground by retreating forces. The Mumma family struggled for years to obtain compensation, receiving only a fraction of what they’d lost. Their story was not unique; accounts throughout the park recount townspeople whose lives, homes, and livelihoods were upended by the battle.

Visiting the Sunken Road provided a visceral connection to the carnage that occurred underfoot. It’s both easy and difficult to grasp the horrors faced by Union soldiers as they advanced on entrenched enemy positions. The thought of watching comrades fall beside you is haunting, and it’s hard to comprehend the courage required to keep moving forward.

The tour ends with stops at the Burnside Bridge and the final push into Sharpsburg. Standing on the bridge, looking up at 100-foot-high bluffs, it’s clear that the men’s lived experiences were truly hellish. The odds they faced were staggering, yet their actions would forever shape history.

## Reflections: Experiencing History

We spent nearly four hours exploring the battlefield, leaving hot, tired, and deeply moved by what we’d learned. The park’s preservation, detailed explication, and the framing of personal stories mean that visiting is not just about learning history—it’s about experiencing it. Walking these fields is nothing like reading battle maps; being there brings home the reality that all who were involved—soldiers and civilians alike—lost something that day.

Despite uniforms or beliefs, the suffering was universal. The residents of Sharpsburg had their lives altered in ways that ripple forward in time. Yet, as you delve deeper into the events of September 17, 1862, you also come to understand that, despite the enormity of loss, some fights are worth waging. After Antietam, the Civil War became not just a battle to preserve the Union, but also a war for freedom and equality. The Union soldiers who died could never have known the impact their sacrifice would have on future generations. Standing at Antietam, it’s clear that their legacy endures—freedom and equality become a little more real because of what happened on those fields.
